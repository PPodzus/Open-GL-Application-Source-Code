This is a simple application done in OpenGL with help of GLUT 3.7 (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/).
The application displays a hard-coded string of letters to the screen, while the user has the ability to move and rotate
it around, with few additional effects available.
Keys:
[1] Random colours for each vertex & background each frame 
[2] Random colours per letter
[R] Randomize letters
[W] Rotate Text Up
[A] Rotate Text Left
[S] Rotate Text Down
[D] Rotate Text Right
[I] Move Text Up
[J] Move Text Left
[K] Move Text Down
[L] Move Text Right
[0] Exit
